The plan so far is to create a simple accessible audio book Android app.  I see
this made of three Android activity classes, and one service.  The service would
handle the actual playing of audio files, speed up, and would provide all
information about the library, chapter headings, etc.  The first activity would
be a list view of books in the library, the second would be the chapters in the
selected book, and the third woudl be the actual audio book player.  On the
first two views, one of the list elements would be a widget stating what is
currently playing.

The player itself needs several widgets.  It needs a text widget to state the
name of the book and chapter playing.  It needs a slider bar to select where in
the chapter to play, and forward/backward buttons to move around 20 seconds
forward or back, and also buttons to move by whole chapters.  Speed control
should be two more buttons, or maybe a spinner control.  In the menu, perhaps
the user could set pitch.  Settings like speed, pitch, and bookmarks should be
book specific and saved by the playback service.
